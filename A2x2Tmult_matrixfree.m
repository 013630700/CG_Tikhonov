% function [ res ] = A2x2Tmult_matrixfree(c11,c12,c21,c22,m,ang,N)

% two images and two energies with using iradon.

% 
% Routine for the two-energies and two materials scheme related to S Siltanen's 
% method for solution of the conjugate gradient Tikhonov algorithm. Computes 
% multiplication A^T*m of the combination system matrix transpose (without 
% the matrix)and the combined measurements m, which refer to measurements of 
% material one (iodine) and material two (aluminum).
% 
% Arguments
% c11       attenuation coefficient for material one (iodine) imaged with energy E1=30kV (low)
% c12       attenuation coefficient for material two (al) imaged with energy E1=30kV (low)
% c21       attenuation coefficient for material one (iodine) imaged with energy E2=50kV (high)
% c22       attenuation coefficient for material two (al) imaged with energy E1=50kV (high)
% m         measurement (sinogram) of material one
% ang       measurement angles used in X-raying the target
% Returns
% res       gives unfiltered backprojection of the images and gives unfiltered
%           images one top of each another

% Perform the needed matrix multiplications. Now a.' multiplication has been
% switched to iradon
am1 = iradon(m1,ang,'none');

am2 = iradon(m2,ang,'none');
am2 = am2(2:end-1,2:end-1);
am2 = corxn*am2;

% Compute the parts of the result individually
res1 = c11*am1(:);
res2 = c21*am2(:);
res3 = c12*am1(:);
res4 = c22*am2(:);

% Collect the results together
