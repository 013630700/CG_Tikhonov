% This function calculates multiplication A*g for system with two images
% and two materials, without constructing the matrix A.
g1 = g(1:(end/2));
g1 = reshape(g1,[N N]);
g2 = g((end/2+1):end);
g2 = reshape(g2,[N N]);

% Perform the needed matrix multiplications. Now a matrix multiplication
% has been switched to radon
ag1 = radon(g1,ang);
ag2 = radon(g2,ang);

% Calculate the parts needed for block matrix multiplication
res1 = c11*ag1(:);
res2 = c12*ag2(:);
res3 = c21*ag1(:);
res4 = c22*ag2(:);

% Combine results into the result
res = [res1 + res2; res3 + res4];
